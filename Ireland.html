<p><DD> Home to Kilkenny Castle, one of the most magical spots in Ireland, Kilkenny is the former medieval capital of Ireland. Along with the castle, the town's historic courtyards and churches make for a picturesque backdrop for the town's month-long Yulefest celebration, which creatively combines historic and modern traditions. The James Stephens Military Barracks & Museum hosts a special reenactment of the WWI Christmas truce. Yulefest entertainment includes fire performers, jesters, pantomimes, and concerts of every genre. Kilkenny also has a Christmas market, Victorian carousel, ice skating rink, Christmas village, and more. </DD> </p>
