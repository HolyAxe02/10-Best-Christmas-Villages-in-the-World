<p><DD>Bath is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and its historic buildings make a charming setting for holiday celebrations. The Christmas market has more than 250 stalls, and most of the goods on sale are handmade. A short walk from the market is Royal Victoria Park, where guests can enjoy Bath on Ice, a winter attraction that includes a 3,200-square-foot ice skating rink, as well as a glow-in-the-dark mini-golf course. The No. 1 Royal Crescent museum, which gets festooned with period decor for the season, hosts lectures and presentations about the history of the city's Christmas celebrations.</DD></p>

<h2><DD> A Sustainable Market </DD></h2>
<p><DD>Sustainability is at the heart of Bath Christmas Market. Each year we strive to be more environmentally responsible and make a positive impact on the city. This ensures that we are a leader in Event Sustainability for the Bath and North East Somerset region. As of  2024, we only use one generator on site,  which uses HVO to lower our carbon emissions, bringing us closer to our goal of being carbon-neutral. We also use reusable or biodegradable alternatives to plastic (where possible) to minimise single-use plastic on site. </DD></p>
