<p><DD>While big celebrations take place in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the idyllic Highlands capital of Inverness is the place to be for a small-town Scottish Christmas. The town kicks off the holiday season with a torchlight parade and lighting ceremony at the annual Christmas Lights Switch-On. Whin Park hosts a winter festival where visitors can meet Santa and his reindeer, while the Victorian Market offers shopping. Head to Eden Court to catch a traditional British panto (short for pantomime) performance. Inverness also hosts a family-friendly Highland Hogmanay Fling with dancing, fireworks, and more. </DD></p>
